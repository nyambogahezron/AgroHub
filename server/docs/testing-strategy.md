# AgroHub API Test Strategy

This document outlines the overall testing approach for the AgroHub API server.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized into the following categories:

### Controller Tests

Isolated tests for each controller in the API, covering all CRUD operations and error cases.

### GraphQL Resolver Tests

Tests for GraphQL queries and mutations to ensure they function as expected.

### Integration Tests

End-to-end tests that simulate user journeys across multiple API endpoints.

### Authentication Tests

Special focus on testing authentication and authorization across the API.

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies (if not already installed)
npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest supertest @types/supertest mongodb-memory-server

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- tests/authController.test.ts
```

## Test Coverage Goals

| Component         | Coverage Goal |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Controllers       | 85%           |
| GraphQL Resolvers | 85%           |
| Middleware        | 90%           |
| Utils             | 80%           |

## Test Implementation Status

| Component          | Status       | Coverage |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| Authentication     | ✅           | TBD      |
| Users              | ✅           | TBD      |
| Organizations      | ✅           | TBD      |
| Organization Users | ✅           | TBD      |
| Products           | ✅           | TBD      |
| Budgets            | ✅           | TBD      |
| Transactions       | ✅           | TBD      |
| Subscriptions      | ✅           | TBD      |
| Notifications      | ✅           | TBD      |
| GraphQL Resolvers  | ⚠️ (Partial) | TBD      |
| Integration        | ✅           | N/A      |

## Testing Techniques

### Mocking

For external dependencies like email services, payment gateways, etc.

```typescript
// Example of mocking an external service
jest.mock('../utils/sendEmail', () => ({
	sendEmail: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ success: true }),
}));
```

### Isolated Database Testing

Using MongoDB Memory Server to create a clean test environment for each test run.

### Authentication Testing

Special focus on testing both authenticated and unauthenticated access to all endpoints.

## Best Practices

1. Each test should be independent and idempotent
2. Clean up test data after each test run
3. Use descriptive test names following the pattern: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
4. Test both happy path and error cases
5. Use helper functions for common setup tasks

## Adding New Tests

When adding tests for new features:

1. Create a new test file if it's a new controller/resolver
2. Follow the pattern of existing tests
3. Ensure proper authentication and authorization testing
4. Add integration tests for critical user flows
5. Update this document with the new test status

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are automatically run in the CI/CD pipeline. Pull requests will not be approved if:

1. Tests fail
2. Coverage drops below the established thresholds
3. New features are added without corresponding tests
